Provide Windows Setup ISO file. (Notice: I don't provide the product keys)

### When does an ISO be uploaded?
When an OS end of Microsoft's support, the ISOs of the OS is going to be uploaded.
If an OS still supported from Microsoft, please go to Microsoft official website to get its ISOs.

### How can I get the ISOs?
1. Go to the [release pages](https://github.com/cheny0y0/windows-iso-source/releases) to get them.
2. [Search them](https://cheny0y0.github.io/windows-iso-source/search.html), and you can specify types and versions. If you can't find them, they're not be uploaded.

### Are the ISOs free?
Yes. But you need to active Windows by yourself.

### Are there beta OSes' ISOs?
Emâ€¦ I don't upload beta OSes' ISOs, but you can open an issue and describe the OS(es)' ISO(s), you'll be a collaborator and upload the ISO(s) to specify release page(s)
